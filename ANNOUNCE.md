# Announcing Caterva 0.3.0: a simple multidimensional container for compressed data


## What is new?

Big code and API refactorization.  As result, the API is more consistent and hopefully more intuitive to use.  For more info on the new API, see https://caterva.readthedocs.io.

For more info, please see the release notes in:

https://github.com/Blosc/Caterva/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md


## What is it?

Caterva is an open source C library and a format that allows to store large multidimensional,
chunked, compressed datasets.

Data can be stored either in-memory or on-disk, but the API to handle both versions is the same.
Compression is handled transparently for the user by adopting the Blosc2 library.
