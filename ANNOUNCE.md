===============================================================
 Announcing Caterva 0.3.0
 A simple, compressed and fast data store library for C
===============================================================

What is new?
============

This is the fourth beta version, adding an important fix for making 64-bit containers to actually work.  Also, a new pluggable threading backend has been added, allowing better interaction with the threading mechanism that you are using in the rest of your program
  (e.g. OpenMP or Intel TBB).  Finally, a cache has been added for on-disk offsets.  This accelerates the reading of slices from disk quite a lot (up to 50% with my benchmarks).

In principle, C-Blosc2 should be backward compatible with C-Blosc, so you can start using it right away and slowly begin to use its new functionality, like the new filters, prefilters, super-chunks and frames.  See docs in: https://blosc-doc.readthedocs.io

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that, even if the API has been declared frozen, that does *not* mean that Blosc2 is ready for production yet: internal structures can change, formats can change and most importantly, bugs can be normal at this stage.  So *do not assume* that your blosc2 data can be read with future versions.

For more info, please see the release notes in:

Also, there is blog post introducing the most relevant changes in Blosc2:

What is it?
===========

Blosc2 is a high performance data container optimized for binary data.  It builds on the shoulders of Blosc, the high performance meta-compressor (https://github.com/c-blosc).

Blosc2 expands the capabilities of Blosc by providing a higher lever container that is able to store many chunks on it (hence the super-block name).  It supports storing data on both memory and disk using the same API.  Also, it adds more compressors and filters.
