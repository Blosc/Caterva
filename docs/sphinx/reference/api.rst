C API
=====

The entire development of the Caterva core has been done with the C programming
language.
This choice allows Caterva to obtain:

 * High performance in the treatment of multidimensional arrays.
 * Better interaction with other languages like Python, R...
 * Portability to a wide variety of computing platforms and operating systems.

On the following pages you can find a detailed description of the
entire C Caterva API.
